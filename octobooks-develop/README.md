# octobooks

Octobooks is a reading tracker and book cataloguing application developped in shiny.

The current version can only be run locally by lauching the app from R. Download this repo to get the app script and attached resources. The app can then be launched either from the R console (`shiny::runApp('Octobooks/octobooks.R', launch.browser = TRUE)`, adapt path accordingly), or through the RStudio IDE ("Run App" button on source pane).
